# **ALX 0x05. C - Pointers, arrays and strings**
Writing code projects in the following:
1. a function that takes a pointer to an int as parameter and updates the value it points to to 98.
2. a function that swaps the values of two integers.
3. a function that returns the length of a string.
4. a function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout.
5. a function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line.
6. a function that reverses a string.
7. a function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line.
8. a function that prints half of a string, followed by a new line.
9. a function that prints n elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line.
10. a function that copies the string pointed to by src, including the terminating null byte (\0), to the buffer pointed to by dest.
11. a function that convert a string to an integer.
12. a program that generates random valid passwords for the program 101-crackme.

## **Rules**
- Allowed editoors for pointers, Arrays, strings and structures task: vi, vim, emacs <br>

- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 <br>

- All files should end with a new line <br>

- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory <br>

- Code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl <br>

- Not allowed to use global variables <br>

- No more than 5 functions per file <br>

- Not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, etc… is forbidden <br>

- Allowed to use _putchar <br>

- Don’t have to push _putchar.c, it won’t be taken into account <br>

- In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. Use them to test your functions, but don’t have to push them to repo. Main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples <br>

- The prototypes of all functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in header file called main.h <br>

- Don’t forget to push header file <br>
